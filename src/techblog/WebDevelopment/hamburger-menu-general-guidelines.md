I have found the humble “hamburger” menu to be one of the hardest things about front-end design. There are almost too many resources on the “right way” to make an accessible menu. However, I have found some general guidelines for a “good way” to implement menus.

* Make sure there is a logical tab order to the menu.
* Use proper semantics by making use of the navigation tag and placing menu items in an unordered list. Also, be sure to make use of nested lists for submenus.
