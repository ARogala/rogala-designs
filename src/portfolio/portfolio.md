		<p class="featuredwork__description-p">Zombie Squash was originally coded for Udacity's Front End Nano-degree program. It demonstrates use of object-oriented programming in JavaScript. I had a lot of fun building this game and, in the process, even learned a bit about basic game engine design.</p><br/>
		<p class="featuredwork__description-p">In order to sharpen my skills and make the project uniquely mine, I added lots of addition features that were not part of the original specification. Some of the extra features include: multiple types of enemies, sound effects, music, and a bigger tile board!!</p><br/>
		<p class="featuredwork__description-p">Use the arrow or wasd keys to move your player safely across the board and eat some brains!! Sorry NO mobile phone support for this game. The code and full list of game play rules are available on GitHub.<br/>
