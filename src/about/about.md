<h3>Welcome</h3>
<P>Hi I am glad you found me. I first discovered my interest in programming and computer science in 2014 during an academic year of Java at Montclair State University. Since then I never really stopped learning about programming and computers. I have tinkered with Python and the Raspberry Pi, learned some statistical programming with R in a data mining course, assembled my dual boot gaming pc, written a few basic Linux shell scripts, and even picked up a little Excel VBA at work to automate some calculations.</P>
