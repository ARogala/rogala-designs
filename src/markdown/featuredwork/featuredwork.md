		<h3 class="heading-tertiary">CSFeedy</h3>
		<p class="featuredwork__description-p">For those who aren’t sure, a feed reader is simply a program that allows
		users to gather and display content from numerous web sites all in one location.
		You can store hundreds of feeds in CSFeedy and see content from each web site without having to navigate
		to the sites individually. Check out this <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-rss-2483592">article</a> for some more information.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="featuredwork__description-p">CSFeedy (Client-Side Feed Reader) is a single page web application built with
		<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> JavaScript.
		Some major dependencies are <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss-parser">rss-parser</a> to parse the
		feeds on the client’s machine and <a href="https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere">CORS Anywhere</a> proxy server
		which allows feeds to be loaded in the browser. Many thanks to the maintainers of these
		projects without whom this application wouldn’t be possible.</p><br/>
		<p class="featuredwork__description-p">This project was fun and challenging to develop.
        I hope you enjoy using this application; I use it every day.
		You can read more about the development of CSFeedy on the apps about page.
		Also, feel free to check out the code for this application on its GitHub page.<br/>

		<h3 class="heading-tertiary">Yank and Brit Art</h3>
		<p class="featuredwork__description-p">Yank and Brit Art is a custom designed art blog site; just established in 2018. This JAM Stack blog is build with GatsbyJS. I developed this custom blog to help my wife, Katie, showcase her talented art work for her Etsy shop. We both enjoyed the design process and hope you enjoy browsing through the site. More content coming soon.<br/>

		<h3 class="heading-tertiary">Custom Home Page</h3>
		<p class="featuredwork__description-p">The Custom Home Page program is a single page web app built with React, Redux, and the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap API</a>. Building this app was fun! Some challenging aspects were: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/">API request throttling</a>, and the functionality to change background image categories and select a personalized set of quick link icons.</p><br/>
		<p class="featuredwork__description-p">Features include: three search bars, slide show, a custom clock with date, weather, and popular icon links. This is a redo of the first piece of code I posted on GitHub and I have learned a lot since then.<br/>
