<p>I first discovered my interest in programming and computer science in 2014 during an academic year of Java at Montclair State University. Since then I never really stopped learning about programming and computers. I have tinkered with Python and the Raspberry Pi, learned some statistical programming with R in a data mining course, assembled my dual boot gaming pc, written a few basic Linux shell scripts, and even picked up a little Excel VBA at work to automate some calculations.</p><br/>

<p>I have chosen to focus on front-end web development and am working hard toward this goal. I love JavaScript and web development because there is such a great learning community, and with a few clicks of a button suddenly your code is a live website. I am drawn to this field because not only do I enjoy the front-end web design aspect of making a web site look just right, but I also love solving the complex problems involved in the technical side of front end programming. It just feels like the right mix of art and technology for me. I am currently focused on HTML, CSS with SASS, JavaScript, Gatsby Static Site Generator, and the React UI library.</p><br/>

<p>Eventually I would like to be a little more full-stack, but for now I feel it is most important to specialize my skills for those front-end jobs. I am not sure which server-side language I will choose to specialize in, but I have a feeling I will learn mostly Node.js as I see the benefit of JavaScript on both the server and client. Anyway, check out this interesting article on the two popular server side languages <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3166109/application-development/php-vs-nodejs-an-epic-battle-for-developer-mind-share.html">PHP vs NodeJS</a>.<br/><br/>Hope to work with you soon.</p>
