		<p class="featuredwork__description-p">For those who aren’t sure, a feed reader is simply a program that allows
		users to gather and display content from numerous web sites all in one location.
		You can store hundreds of feeds in CSFeedy and see content from each web site without having to navigate
		to the sites individually. Check out this <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-rss-2483592">article</a> for some more information.<br/><br/>
		CSFeedy (Client-Side Feed Reader) is a single page web application built with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> JavaScript.
		Some major dependencies are <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss-parser">rss-parser</a> to parse the
		feeds on the client’s machine and <a href="https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere">CORS Anywhere</a> proxy server
		which allows feeds to be loaded in the browser. Many thanks to the maintainers of these
		projects without whom this application wouldn’t be possible.<br/><br/>
		This project was fun and challenging to develop. I hope you enjoy using this application; I use it every day.
		You can read more about the development of CSFeedy on the apps about page.
		Also, feel free to check out the code for this application on its GitHub page.<br/>
