<h3>Welcome</h3>
<P>Hi I am glad you found me. I first discovered my interest in programming and computer science in 2014 during an academic year of Java at Montclair State University. Since then I never really stopped learning about programming and computers. I have tinkered with Python and the Raspberry Pi, learned some statistical programming with R in a data mining course, assembled my dual boot gaming pc, written a few basic Linux shell scripts, and even picked up a little Excel VBA at work to automate some calculations.</P>

<p>Recently, I have been lucky enough to take this hobby of mine and pursue it full time. I have chosen to focus on front-end web development and am working hard toward this goal. I love JavaScript and web development because there is such a great learning community, and with a few clicks of a button suddenly your code is a live website. I am drawn to this field because not only do I enjoy the front-end web design aspect of making a web site look just right, but I also love solving the complex problems involved in the technical side of front end programming. It just feels like the right mix of art and technology for me. I am currently focused on HTML, CSS with SASS, JavaScript, and the React UI library.</p>
